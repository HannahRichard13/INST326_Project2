      "In python, there is 3 types of files you can save. These files include text files, csv files, and json files. To save a text file, you need to open a file with the “w” argument so you can write in the file. Then you need to user the “f.write” method to write in the content you want to go in the file. To read this file, we need to open the same file that we just added text to using the “r” argument. Then we need to use the “.readlines” method to read each line. We then save these lines to a list and iterate through the list. Each iteration we need to strip part of it and then take the content and add it to a dictionary or list. Or we can print the contents. To save a csv file, first we need to import the CSV module. Then, we need to open the file and use the “w” argument to write in code. We then use the “csv.DictWriter” method and use the correct arguments. Then we use the “writeheader()” method to organize the dictionary. Lastly, we iterate through notes, and write in head writerow from list we iterate through. To read in the csv file, we need to open the csv file, but this time using the “r” argument so that we read the file and to write it. Then we need to use the “DictReader” method on the csv file. This will go through the rows of the csv file and then we can add the content in each row to a list, or print it out. To save a json file, we need to first import the JSON module. Then, once we have imported the module, we need to open the file we want and use the “w” argument. Then we use the json.dump() method which writes in all the content to the file. To read a JSON file, we need to open the JSON file and then load all the content that is in the file using json.load() method. We can store all of this load content into a list or other variable.\n",
