Title: 
Saving Files in Python

Text:
In python, there is 3 types of files you can save. These files include text files, csv files, and json files. To save a text file, you need to open a file with the “w” argument so you can write in the file. Then you need to user the “f.write” method to write in the content you want to go in the file. To read this file, we need to open the same file that we just added text to using the “r” argument. Then we need to use the “.readlines” method to read each line. We then save these lines to a list and iterate through the list. Each iteration we need to strip part of it and then take the content and add it to a dictionary or list. Or we can print the contents. To save a csv file, first we need to import the CSV module. Then, we need to open the file and use the “w” argument to write in code. We then use the “csv.DictWriter” method and use the correct arguments. Then we use the “writeheader()” method to organize the dictionary. Lastly, we iterate through notes, and write in head writerow from list we iterate through. To read in the csv file, we need to open the csv file, but this time using the “r” argument so that we read the file and to write it. Then we need to use the “DictReader” method on the csv file. This will go through the rows of the csv file and then we can add the content in each row to a list, or print it out. To save a json file, we need to first import the JSON module. Then, once we have imported the module, we need to open the file we want and use the “w” argument. Then we use the json.dump() method which writes in all the content to the file. To read a JSON file, we need to open the JSON file and then load all the content that is in the file using json.load() method. We can store all of this load content into a list or other variable.

Title:
Types of Data in Python

Text:
In python, there are several data types you may encounter and need to use when programming. These data types include text, number, sequences, mapping, sets, Booleans, and none. Text data types come in the form of strings. Numeric data types come in the form of integers, floats, and complex. Sequence types come in the form of lists, tuples, and range. Mapping types come in the form od dictionaries. Set types come in the form of set or frozenset. Boolean types come in the form of bool. Lastly, none types come in the form of NoneType.

Title:
Functions in Python

Text:
When you are coding and you are noticing that part of your code is constantly being repeated, this is a sign that you could need to use a function to simplify your code. Functions in python can be run whenever you call the function, and you can pass data through them in the form of parameters. To create a function, you use the word “def” followed by the name of your function and parenthesis. Then you use a colon and start writing your lines of code indented beneath the line you have just written. Functions can be made for anything, and they are fun to make.

Note 1: 

Title: Creating code and committing it into a new repo from working copy 

1. From the repositories view in the app, drag the project folder to the bottom of the left sidebar.
2. Hit "Yes" when it asks if you want to create a local git repository
3. Go to "Changes" view
4. Select the files that you want to commit their current state to the repository. You can view the changes of the file by clicking on the double up arrow on the file name bar.
5. Type a commit summary, usually a description of what you've just added or changed.
6. Click 'Commit'. This commits the current state of the code to your local repository.

1. Open Terminal.app
2. "cd" to directory
>     cd path/to/directory

3. Initiate a git repository
>     git init .

4. Add existing files
>     git add .

5. Commit all files (-a) and add a message (-m)
>     git commit -a -m "commit message goes here"

Title: Accessing current Directory using python 

Utilizing os, we can obtain the output of the current directory that we are working within in a string format utilizing the below code snippet. The direct command to obtain said directory is getcwd()

import os

print(os.getcwd())

# Output: C:\Program Files\PyScripter
